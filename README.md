# DASHBOARD_PROJECT
## PROJECT 1 : IBM HR DASHBOARD
### 
This visual analytics designed to provide insights into Human Resources (HR) data within an organization. By integrating Tableau (a popular data visualization tool) with HR data from IBM, the dashboard allows HR professionals, managers, and executives to gain deep insights into workforce performance, employee metrics, and other key HR-related data.

### Age by Department and Job Role
**Insight**: "The dashboard shows the distribution of age across departments. For example, in the HR Department, most employees are in the 34-35 age range, while in Sales Excecutive, the employees are predominantly between 37-38 years old."
Age distribution data can help us assess the generational mix within different departments. If one department has a predominantly older workforce, we might need to focus on succession planning or consider offering early retirement packages. Conversely, a younger workforce may require different career development programs to keep them engaged and retain talent.

### Gender In The Company
The gender distribution across the entire company is 60% male and 40% female. However, this distribution varies across departments. For example, the Sales Excecutive role is predominantly male (59%), while the HR department is predominantly female (70%).
Understanding gender distribution is key to promoting gender equality. The skew in departments like Sales could indicate a need for more initiatives to attract female talent in Management fields. Likewise, the dominance of man in HR could be a sign of the new industry trend but might also signal the need for more diversity initiatives roles for women.

### Average Monthlty Income by Department and Job Role
**Insight**: The dashboard shows the average monthly income across different departments and job roles. For instance, the Manufacturing Director has an average monthly income of $7,295, while the Research Director has an average monthly income of $16,034. Within the Sales department, the average monthly income for a Manager is $16,987, whereas a sales excecutive $6,924. 
This data provides an understanding of how compensation is distributed across departments and job roles. It's important to assess if there are significant pay disparities that might affect employee morale or lead to issues with retention.
